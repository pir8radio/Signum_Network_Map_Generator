# Signum Network Map Generator

This repository contains a Python script that generates a KML and KMZ file of the current Signum Nodes and shows links to each node in the network.

## Description

The Signum Network Map Generator is designed to create visual representations of Signum network nodes. It outputs KML and KMZ files that can be used with mapping applications like Google Earth to display the locations and connections of Signum nodes.

## Features

- Generates KML and KMZ files of Signum network nodes.
- Displays links between nodes in the network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` if available)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pir8radio/Signum_Network_Map_Generator.git
   cd Signum_Network_Map_Generator
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Run the script to generate the KML and KMZ files:

```bash
python generate_map.py
```
